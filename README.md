## 🔍 Overview

This study applies Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) complemented with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze students' responses regarding the benefits and potential of eco enzyme as an organic waste management innovation.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `data/raw/`: Contains the original open-ended questionnaire dataset (`student_responses.csv`)
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned and tokenized responses
- `notebooks/`: Main script to run preprocessing and NLP workflow
- `output/visualization/`: Network graph files (.gexf) and visual maps
- `output/tables/`: Extracted n-gram frequency tables and NLP-to-theme mappings
- `LICENSE`: The MIT License file for the project
- `README.md`: Project documentation (this file)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies used in notebook

## 📜 Methods

1. **Text Cleaning & Tokenization**  
2. **POS-based Bigram & Trigram Extraction**  
3. **Network Mapping (GEXF)**  
4. **Theme Mapping from NLP to RTA**

## 🚀 **Reproducing the Analysis**

To run this analysis on your local machine, please follow the steps below.

#### **1. Prerequisites**
* Python 3.8+
* Git

#### **2. Installation & Setup**
